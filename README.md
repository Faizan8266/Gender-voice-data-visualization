# Gender-voice-data-visualization

This project trains a computer program to identify a voice as male or female,
based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 3,168
recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers.The voice samples are pre-processed by
acoustic analysis in python with machine learning algorithms to learn gender-specific traits for classifying
the voice as male or female.
